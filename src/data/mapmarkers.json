The pedigree engine under its hood puts this car on equal footing with professional racing vehicles, and the interior feels like a 5-star penthouse suite.

Though not as slick and flashy as the Turbo-R or the Type-66, the Bandit boasts two elements that make it a cult classic: enough horsepower to outrun any other dragster and heaps of soul. When asked what he sees of himself in the model, McCarty supposedly stated that once you take the Bandit's wheel, well – you can't help but commit a traffic violation or three."

This two-seater with a durable engine was marked at an approachable price, but the subtle elegance and sturdiness of its design made it popular among more than just the urban middle class. The Quartz is, as it turns out, well suited to endure the harsh desert climate. As a result, it has become a mainstay vehicle for a large portion of the nomad population.

But beyond the name they also swap out the standard engines for strongers ones, add light armor to the body and install an environment projection system based on CrystalDome tech in the cabin."

Ex-director, I should say. Ever since Bushido X made a loss of a billion, the guy never set foot on a set again.\n\nJacob makes a living playing cards. One time he tried his luck at an illegal Tyger Claws casino at the back of the Kashuu Hanten eatery. Things weren't looking good, but instead of getting up from the table, he waited until he'd recoup. First went all his money, then his watch, wedding ring... And finally, one of his optics.\n\nJacob wants his implant back. Sending you the coordinates of the casino where he lost it. AFAIK, the eye's still there. How you get it is your biz, not mine."

And chaos isn't in our best interest at the moment.\n\nKlep those recordings at the Dicky Twister before the cops do. Thankfully, the Lord has blessed us – Ladrillo is currently out of town.

With that said, can I really blame Mrs. Gutierrez for stripping Mr. Gutierrez down to the last enny? Of course not. In fact, I'd like to meet her lawyers.\n\nBut enough about Mrs. Gutierrez. Our client happens to be the injured party, Mr. Gutierrez. He lost his car and luxury penthouse, now the poor fool has barely anything to live in because he left his depository receipts in their old apartment (the locks are already changed). You'll have to retrieve them, because our new divorcee isn't going to give them back out of the kindness of her heart.\n\nThe penthouse is on the last floor of the building. Don't worry, I'm providing you with elevator access.\n\nFor obvious reasons, Mr. Gutierrez is counting on your utmost discretion. If things go quietly, he'll toss in extra."

Adam's the bad guy and Larry's our client.\n\nOnce upon a time the two friends opened a club called Empathy and things got off the ground pretty quickly. The eddies poured in, their popularity surged, they were surrounded by hordes of young ladies and one question at the back of their minds – who's got their hand in who's pocket? Adam or Larry?\n\nThe blame fell on our innocent, naive Larry.\n\nWhat does Adam do? He changes the club's access codes, made a few shady deals and hired Animals as bouncers. If you were Larry, wouldn't you be pissed?\n\nHere's what you're gonna do. You'll break into Empathy, upload the attached virus to their net and bring the club's operations to a standstill. Empathy won't budge an inch until Adam welcomes his ol' pal Larry back with open arms.\n\nSounds like a breeze, right? Just keep things quiet, no witnesses and everyone'll be happy."
